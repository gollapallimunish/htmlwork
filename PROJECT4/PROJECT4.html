<h1>My Three Favorite Hobbies</h1>

<h2>1. Watching and Playing cricket</h2>

<p class="other">Watching and playing cricket is my all time favorite hobby, its makes me feel fresh and energetic. The twists and turns in the game and the curiosity throughout keeps me out of depressed state of mind. Cricket is a fun sport and  watching the game brings me joy, and it is mostly likely that i will never feel lonely.</p>
<p>In schooling, every eviening I used to play  cricket with my friends and on every sunday we played tournments with the other schoools with lot of game spirit and joy.</p>
<p>Even now I watch every match that india plays weither it may be test or one day internationals or T20I and my all time favorite player is Mahendra Singh Dhoni.</p>

<h2>2. Reading Novels or Books</h2>
<p>I got this habbit from my grandfather and father, by seeing them I got intrest in reading books. Whenever I get a chance or free time I prefer to read a book or novel which is available for me at that time. And I always love to read indian historic books such as Mahabaratam, Ramayanam and Bhagavat geeta. These novels teach us how we can transform in our life if we understand its essence of it. In these novels we will also find some amazing lessons that everyone needs to gain wisdom and knowledge.</p>
<p>I also read novels written by chettan Bhagat,who is one of the indias most influential people and well known author and his colletions consists some novels like Half Girlfriend.</p>
<p>2 states:The story of my marriage and one night at the call center. And most of his novels were  again made into films.</p>

<h2>3. Drawing</h2>
<p>I always enjoyed drawing when I have free time. I started drawing at very young age. I still remember the first picture that I drew was the picture of Lordess Durga.</p>
<p>It always felt very satisfying to hold a pencil and to put my thought on the paper, I belive it will always be a part of me.</p>
<p>My teachers taught me how to draw difficult pictures. They always said "The ability to draw is mainly like expressing how you felt at that momemt". I always like to draw pencil sketches and it is the skill that I developed after practicing everyday.</p>
