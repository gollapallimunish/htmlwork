 <p>I always enjoyed drawing when I have free time. I started drawing at very young age. I still remember the first picture that I drew was the picture of Lordess Durga. It always felt very satisfying to hold a pencil and to put my thought on the paper, I belive it will always be a part of me.</p>
 <p>My teachers taught me how to draw difficult pictures. They always said "The ability to draw is mainly like expressing how you felt at that momemt". I always like to draw pencil sketches and it is the skill that I developed after practicing everyday.</p>
