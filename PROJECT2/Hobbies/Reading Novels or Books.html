 <p>I got this habbit from my grandfather and father, by seeing them I got intrest in reading books. Whenever I get a chance or free time I prefer to read a book or novel which is available for me at that time. And I always love to read indian historic books such as Mahabaratam, Ramayanam and Bhagavat geeta. These novels teach us how we can transform in our life if we understand its essence of it. In these novels we will also find some amazing lessons that everyone needs to gain wisdom and knowledge.</p>
 <p>I also read novels written by chettan Bhagat,who is one of the indias most influential people and well known author and his colletions consists some novels like Half Girlfriend, 2 states:The story of my marriage and one night at the call center. And most of his novels were  again made into films.</p>
