  <h2>Watching and Playing cricket</h2>
  <img border="0" src="../images/cricket.jpg" alt="cricket"  width="200" height="220" />
  <p>Watching and playing cricket is my all time favorite hobby, its makes me feel fresh and energetic. The twists and turns in the game and the curiosity throughout keeps me out of depressed state of mind. Cricket is a fun sport and  watching the game brings me joy, and it is mostly likely that i will never feel lonely.</p>
  <p>In schooling, every eviening I used to play  cricket with my friends and on every sunday we played tournments with the other schoools with lot of game spirit and joy. Even now I watch every match that india plays weither it may be test or one day internationals or T20I and my all time favorite player is Mahendra Singh Dhoni.</p>
